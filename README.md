# Data-pipeline

End-to-end data analytics project using Python, SQL Server, and Tableau for ETL, storage, and visualization.

# End-to-End Data Analytics using Python, SQL Server & Tableau

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow — from data extraction and transformation using Python, to storage and querying with SQL Server, and finally data visualization using Tableau. It aims to generate meaningful business insights through automation and reporting.

• Modular codebase and reusable scripts

# 🧠 Business Problem

• How many customers have churned, and what is the overall churn rate?

• Which customer groups (by gender, internet service type, and contract type) are most likely to churn?

• How does the type of internet service (DSL, Fiber Optic, or None) affect customer churn rates?

• Are customers on month-to-month contracts more likely to leave compared to one- or two-year contracts?

• Which payment methods are most commonly used, and do they influence customer retention?

• How much revenue is generated at different stages of a customer's tenure?

• Who are the top 10 highest-spending customers based on average monthly charges?

• Which type of internet service is the most popular among customers?

• What is the average customer tenure, and how does it relate to loyalty and churn?

• How many senior citizens live alone, and could this impact their likelihood of churning?
